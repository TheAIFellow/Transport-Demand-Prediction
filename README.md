# Transport-Demand-Prediction
In this project I have build a model that predicts the number of seats that Mobiticket can expect to sell for each ride, i.e. for a specific route on a specific date and time. There are 14 routes in this datasetand all of the routes end in Nairobi and originate in towns to the North-West of Nairobi towards Lake Victoria.
